# Lab 2

## Purpose of this Lab
* Exploring Machine Learning methods using sklearn library
* Following the Blackbox Approach, wherein we don't go into the details of all the algorithms but do understand all of the functionality for proper implementation.

## Sequence of the algorithms visited
* First Order Optimization
  1. Normal Equations
  2. Gradient Descent
  3. Statistical approach
  4. Linear Regression
  5. Logistic Regression
  6. K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
  7. Support Vector Machines(SVM)
  

* Second Order Optimization
  1. Newton's methods for Logistic Regression
  2. Parameter estimation - expectaion maximization, Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori(MAP), Naive Bayes
  
* Clustering
  1. Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM)
  2. Self-Organising Maps(SOM)
  
* Tree based methods
  1. Decision Tree
  2. Random Forest (Bagging)
  3. Gradient Boosting Model (Boosting)
  
* Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
