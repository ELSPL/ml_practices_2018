## Description
This internship course amalgamates “Theory” and “Practice” – identifying that a machine learning scientist desires a survey of concepts combined with a strong application of practical techniques through labs. Primarily, the foundational material and tools of the Data Science practitioner are presented via Sk-Learn. Topics continue rapidly into exploratory data analysis and classical machine learning, where the data is organized, characterized, and manipulated. From week three, the students move from engineered models into custom application based approach.
